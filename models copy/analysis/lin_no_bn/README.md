# Linear without normalization

Refer to Section 4.2 (Linear vs. MLP) for this folder.

## Notes 

1. We observed that model diverge and leads to degenerate output in this case.

2. For surface normal estimation, the training produced a reasonable model but the performance improved when we used batch-normalization.
