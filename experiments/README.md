# Experiments

This folder contain example scripts to train a PixelNet model, and a demo code to evaluate a trained model.

1. Training: We give an example of training a model for PASCAL VOC-2012 segmentation dataset (along with the augmented dataset of Hariharan et al.) in the _train/_ folder:

```make
ls train/;
```

2. Test: We give an example of evaluating a model for surface normal estimation in the _demo/_ folder:

```make
ls demo/;
```
